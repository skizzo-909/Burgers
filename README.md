This was my first assignment for Data Structures and Algorithms in my second year.
In this assignment we had to create our own example of a super class with two
sub classe inheriting from the super class. I decided to go with Mc Donald's burgers
since they were my favorite take-out food at the time. The simplicity of this
program is what made me enjoy the module so much, with it I learned that when it
comes to solving porblems, overthinking your solution will result in me not even starting.

It really played a huge role in how I solve problems in my everyday life.
